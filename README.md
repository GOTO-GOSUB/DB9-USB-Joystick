# DB9-USB-Joystick
Carrier board for an Arduino Pro Micro based 9W Joystick to USB converter.

These boards are simple designs to act as carrier boards for the Arduino Pro Micro and a PCB mounted 9 Way D Type connector.
Please see the excellent work by MickGyver here:

Included here are a single and independent dual channel variations. Please note that at the time of writing these PCB designs have been independently verified
but not yet manufactured. Once they have been received from my fabricator and verified in the real world this warning will be removed - until then you use
these board designs at your own risk.
